# WADe_gezr_project
Gesture analyzer

Project description

Having a number of Webcam-captured video streams, build a Web application that detect, classify, compare, and synchronize hand and arm gestures performed by (human) users.
A conceptual model will be created/(re)used in order to express (classes of) gestures, anatomic features, associated actions, etc.
A rule-based approach could be adopted â€“ for example, if the "wave" gesture is detected in at least 74% of video feeds exposed by a video-conferencing system, then the conference session will be ended.
Also, different statistics of interest will be offered in graphical form and as JSON-LD data.
Study An Ontology for Reasoning on Body-based Gestures.
Consult also Awesome Streaming and Recognition APIs.
Bonus: capturing and exposing useful provenance.
